# TinDog Bootstrap Project- The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp Udemy Course by Angela Yu from The App Brewery
I have been following along to the tutorials in the Bootstrap modules in this course, to be able to refresh myself on essential knowledge needed to execute proper demonstration of Bootstrap concepts! I uploaded this project to GitHub for the purpose of showcasing my knowledge of Bootstrap itself.
## What is the TinDog app?
TinDog is a Tinder copycat application. Instead of being a social network for connecting humans together, it connects dogs to their match!
